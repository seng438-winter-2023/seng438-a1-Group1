# Introduction

As a team of developers, we have tested many programs before. This will be the first time we are dedicately only testing a program instead writing a program and testing midway. This means that we were checking for bugs using only exploratory testing and manual functm. ional testing. Now, we will be learning how to test a program in a organzized manner which allows us to find more bugs that comes with our program. To achieve this, we will be using different testing methods such as Manual Scripted Testing and regression testing. Not only are we able to find more, we will be able to track down the steps to reproduce a bug. This will decrease the amount time needed to go through the code and find the bug. 

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

In this lab, we will be testing using a exploratory test plan at at the start. Exploratory testing is what most of us developers have done even if wem do not have a plan. Going forward, we will have to write test plans to make the testing process as organized as possible. The very first step will be to write out a formulated plan to test the program. We will be writing a plan to use explaratory testing to its utmost efficiency. For this, we will tasking each pair to test out certain functions such as transfering. From there, we will look at the test cases marked for that situations and try to play around with the GUI to see what happens when we do not follow the steps given to us in the lab requirements in Appendix C. Of course we will be writing down our steps we did to reach a certain state. When we discover a bug in this stage, we will write down a report in Jira. These will not be marked with MFT but will marked with ver 1.0. IF they are fixed with ver 1.1, we will marked it down as fixed in ver 1.1 and also be marked as done.
