# Introduction

As a team of developers, we have tested many programs before. This will be the first time we are dedicately only testing a program instead writing a program and testing midway. This means that we were checking for bugs using only exploratory testing and manual functional testing. Now, we will be learning how to test a program in a organzized manner which allows us to find more bugs that comes with our program. To achieve this, we will be using different testing methods such as Manual Scripted Testing and regression testing. Not only are we able to find more, we will be able to track down the steps to reproduce a bug. This will decrease the amount time needed to go through the code and find the bug.
